# Title
Mobile Application

## Context
The decision to utilize Firebase as the backend solution for our mobile application development project.
1. Scalability and Performance Concerns: Existing backend infrastructure struggles to handle increasing user base and data volume, leading to slow loading times and performance issues.
2. Cost Optimization: The current backend solution incurs high maintenance and operational costs.

## Decision
We have decided to leverage Firebase as the backend solution for our mobile application development project. Firebase offers several advantages that address our concerns:

Scalability and Performance: Firebase provides a scalable and reliable backend infrastructure that can easily handle our increasing user base and data volume. Its real-time database and cloud storage solutions ensure fast loading times and optimal performance for our mobile application.
Cost Optimization: Firebase offers a cost-effective solution for backend infrastructure. Its pay-as-you-go pricing model allows us to only pay for the resources we use, reducing maintenance and operational costs compared to our current solution.

## Rationale
Firebase offer lots of tools and solution for complete backend service in their own. It's provide scalability in later. developer can start without cost and can extended their own budget later.

## Consequences
Pros – Firebase is powerful platform for mobile app development and strong backend for new developer and comprehensive set of features and services that can accelerate development and simplify backend infrastructure management.

Cons – Carefully consider requirement and potential before commited project in firebase.

## Sample code
This is Kotlin integrated with Firebase Authentication and Cloud Firestore(For traditional android app)
```kotlin
// Add Firebase Authentication and Firestore dependencies to build.gradle file
implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-auth-ktx:20.0.4'
implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-firestore-ktx:23.0.2'

// Import necessary Firebase modules in your Kotlin file
import com.google.firebase.auth.FirebaseAuth
import com.google.firebase.firestore.FirebaseFirestore

// Initializing Firebase services
val auth: FirebaseAuth = FirebaseAuth.getInstance()
val db: FirebaseFirestore = FirebaseFirestore.getInstance()

// Signup user with email and password
auth.createUserWithEmailAndPassword(email, password)
    .addOnCompleteListener(this) { task ->
        if (task.isSuccessful) {
            // Sign up successful, save user data to Firestore
            val user = hashMapOf(
                "email" to email,
                // Add more user data fields as needed
            )
            db.collection("users").document(auth.currentUser?.uid ?: "")
                .set(user)
                .addOnSuccessListener {
                    // User data saved successfully
                }
                .addOnFailureListener { e ->
                    // Error saving user data
                }
        } else {
            // Sign up failed
        }
    }

// Sign out
auth.signOut()

// Event listener
auth.addAuthStateListener { firebaseAuth ->
    val user = firebaseAuth.currentUser
    if (user != null) {
        // User is signed in
    } else {
        // User is signed out
    }
}
