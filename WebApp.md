# Title
Web Application

## Context
The decision to utilize Firebase as the backend solution for our web application development project.

The need for a robust and scalable backend solution arose due to:

1. Long development time and resource constraints:

Challenge: Building and managing a custom backend from scratch requires significant development time and resources, delaying launch and stretching the team.

2. Lack of specific functionalities:

Current solution: The current backend lacks features like user authentication, real-time updates, or static file hosting, hindering desired app functionalities.
## Decision
Firebase provides a comprehensive set of tools and services that can significantly simplify the development process for web apps, allowing us to focus on building great user experiences. Therefore, we use Firebase to address the issue.


## Rationale
Firebase provide multiple tools to web application development, The large community of firebase make it strong beneficial to developer. Firebase provide dependency to many programming language(ie. Javascripts and Java SpringBoot) and the strongest benefit is scalability.

## Consequences
Pros – What becomes easier?
Cons – What becomes more difficult?

## Sample code
Give some sample code related to this decision.
